## UPDATE 2025-01-29

I'm going to work on making a web server for interacting with the plex tools.  You can follow along the project here:

bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/johnsturgeon/autoplex/raw/main/scripts/deploy.sh)"
```

## Scripts
You can read about the CLI version of `deduplex.py` [here](docs/deduplex.md)
