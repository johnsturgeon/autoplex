## UPDATE 2025-01-29

I'm going to work on making a web server for interacting with the plex tools.  You can follow along the project here:
[Prioritized backlog Â· Create a website for the plex-tools](https://github.com/users/johnsturgeon/projects/8)

## Prerequisites for running the web server
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
* [Installation - Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/) (for version management)


## Scripts
You can read about the CLI version of `deduplex.py` [here](docs/deduplex.md)
